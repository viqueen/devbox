# devbox

## Playground - try it before you buy it

- ubuntu

```bash

## Setup and Configure

> :warning: this is heavily tailored towards bash, so may not work out of the (dev)box
> for zsh (zush) and friends

```bash

## Scripts and Binaries

### tricks up this sleeve : from anywhere

- navigate to where devbox is installed

```bash
. dev
```

- open existing scripts for edit

```bash
dev edit
gitar edit
```

- create a new script in devbox

```bash
dev edit mynewscript
```

> :information_source: all these scripts source `selfedit.sh`
> which allows you to quickly step into edit mode (uses vim under the hood)
>
> `selfedit.sh` also sources `selfdoc.sh` which allows you to add documentation hints
> to your commands

```bash
#! /usr/bin/env
source selfedit.sh

# @COMMAND one              does this and that
one() {
    echo "one"
}

# @COMMAND two              does these and those
two() {
    echo "two"
}

eval $@

if [[ -z $1 ]]; then
    $0 -h
fi
```

> :x: but please note that not all scripts in devbox follow this pattern

### housekeeping and generic scripts

```bash
dev -h          # mainframe
mvnup -h        # maven version upgrade
jsonf           # json pretty format
image -h        # docker things
gitar -h        # git things
saymyname       # finds the longest java class name in a directory , I was bored once so I wrote this
```

### Atlassian scripts

> :warning: these are wrappers around the atlassian-sdk
> so please make sure you have it installed

<details>
<summary>install_atlassian_sdk</summary>
<p>

- mac OS

```bash
brew tap atlassian/tap
brew install atlassian/tap/atlassian-plugin-sdk
```

- for other platforms, please take a look at https://developer.atlassian.com/server/framework/atlassian-sdk/downloads/

</p>
</details>

It comes with the following enterprise product scripts that behave exactly the same

```bash
atlas -h        # mainframe

# running and debugging atlassian server instances
confluence -h
jira -h
bitbucket -h
bamboo -h
fecru -h
crowd -h
```

Each of them comes with the following functions

```
start [version]                          starts product
debug [version]                          starts product with debug port
clean [version-pattern]                  cleans product directory for given version pattern
versions                                 lists installed product versions
cmd [action] [version]                   displays resolved command
get [version]                           cd to product's installed version
view [version]                           view product logs
wars                                     lists available versions in local maven repo
```

So in the case of Confluence, I usually kick off my dev by launching the version I am interested in

- start the instance
  `confluence start 6.15.4`
- monitor the logs
  `confluence logs 6.15.4`
- list the version I have already installed
  `confluence versions`

The instances are installed under `.atlassian-products` directory

### Atlassian Devbox Plugins

These are development helper plugins I use in all my feature/bug-fix endeavours

#### confluence

```bash
# build it
cd atlassian-devbox-plugins/confluence-devbox-plugin
atlas build
# update the following to match your context path and port
atlas pi confluence 8080

# setup an smtp server
confdev post setup smtp-server
# create multiple users
confdev post setup users
```

> :information_source: `confdev` script is available under `cli/bin` , this is just a rest client to interact with
> confluence-devbox-plugin rest resources.
>
> Note that these are just the basics, but I trust you can poke around the repo to find out how to tune
> the options so the scripts are interacting correctly with the confluence instance you are running (in terms of port, context path, user creds)

### Elastic scripts

It comes with the following enterprise product scripts that behave exactly the same

```bash
search -h
entsearch -h
kibana -h
logstash -h
filebeat -h
```

While I sort out a smooth easy to start elastic stack locally with one script, I navigate to the elastic products
I want by running the following

```bash
. search get 7.5.0
. entsearch get 7.5.0
. kibana get 7.5.0
. logstash get 7.5.0
. filebeat get 7.5.0
```

The above commands also take care of downloading the artifacts

> :warning: please notice the `_distro() { echo "darwin-x86_64" }` in `elastic-product.sh`, you
> probably want to adjust that to whatever distro you need for your platform.
